# CosmWasm NFTS

This repo is the official repository to work on all NFT standard and examples
in the CosmWasm ecosystem. `cw721` and `cw721-base` were moved from
[`cw-plus`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus) to start this repo, but it shall evolve
as driven by the community's needs.

Please feel free to modify `cw721-base` as you need to support these projects and add many extensions
and additional standards (like [cw-2981](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/pull/414)) to meet
the demands of the various NFT projects springing forth.
